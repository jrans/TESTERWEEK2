Hey! 

How to test a http request?

Well what is a http request?

Whenever your web browser fetches a file (a page, a picture, etc) from a web server, it does so using HTTP - that's "Hypertext Transfer Protocol".  HTTP is a request/response protocol, which means your computer sends a request for some file (e.g. "Get me the file 'home.html'"), and the web server sends back a response ("Here's the file", followed by the file itself).


Accessing the tested file via Iframe -> You need to :

-> Set up a local host with Python -> Simple HTTP Server with Python
